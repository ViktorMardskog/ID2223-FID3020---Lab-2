Very small qualitative comparison:

We compare brainstorming function between these models (using the brainstorming button in combination with expanded ideas):
- Model trained on 12K exampels from FineTome-100k
- Model trained on 8K from Wanfq/Explore_Instruct_Brainstorming_10k

Note that this is not meant to provide strong evidence for which of the models is better, but rather gives an overview of how answers could differ.

Four examples: 
1.Expanded idea: "A tool sharing app to borrow tools from neighbours."
